# Ladder-and-Snake-Game
Project Date: WINTER SEMESTER 2022
Project Description: Ladder and Snake Game played on a squares board - 10 by 10 numbered 1 through 100. Before any of the players starts playing, the order of playing turns must be determined. Each player must throw the dice to obtain the largest possible number. In case of a tie between any of the players, the process is repeated only between those players. This process is concluded once the order of playing is determined. The players start playing the game by alternating dice flipping and move up if their number lands on a ladder and moves down if their number lands on a snake. The game is over when one player hits the 100th square.
